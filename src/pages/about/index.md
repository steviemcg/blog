I'm a Sitecore trainer and consultant living in Utrecht, The Netherlands. Until recently I was Lead Developer for the Email Experience Manager (EXM) team in the Sitecore Product Department.

These days, I am "Sitecore Technology Director" for [ParTech](http://www.partech.nl/), a small consultancy based in Den Bosch, The Netherlands. I'm helping build up ParTech Academy with several new trainings, helping us stay involved in the community by contributing to open source, and doing whatever I can to spread knowledge.

I started web development in 1998, when I launched an ecommerce site selling Karaoke versions of popular music together with a friend of mine from The Netherlands. In our peak we had over 35 musicians contributing MIDIs and MP3s from their bedroom studios. We had a lot of fun along the way, until eventually Napster and piracy in general saw our profits nose-dive. That taught us a valuable lesson: when you start something, you have to go all-in, and you always need to be ready to adapt. Unfortunately it was only ever a side-project and we closed our doors in 2007.

I help run, along with a great team, the [Sitecore UK User Groups](http://meetup.com/sug-uk/). They happen every 2 or 3 months, and are a great place to meet other users and developers, and get some free food and drink. I hope to meet you there soon.

Outside of work, I'd love to say that I'm the kind of person who loves mountain biking, hiking, jogging, exploring, travelling and so on. Well, I do, when I can be bothered ;-) But you're much more likely to find me at home enjoying a steak & beer, playing piano & xbox, and watching Netflix with my wife & daughter.
